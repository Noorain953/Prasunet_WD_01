        <h1>Discover Destinations</h1>
        <p>Immerse yourself in the beauty and culture of destinations around the world. From iconic landmarks to hidden gems, explore the places that make our planet extraordinary.</p>
        <h2>Kamchatka:</h2>
        <p>The Kamchatka Peninsula in Northeast Siberia, Russia, is one of the least explored places in the world. The peninsula is a region of geological wonders, with volcanoes (some of which are pretty active), bays, geysers, and many more.
The region is also home to diverse wildlife, including a wide range of salmon species and brown bears. In fact, it is considered to have the densest population of brown bears in the world. Being a very remote and difficult-to-explore region, this peninsula is still largely unexplored, and only 400,000 people live on it, which is a pretty small number for such a huge area.<br>
<b>Why it's Special:</b>Stunning natural features like volcanoes and geysers, plus plenty of wildlife<br>
<b>Location:</b> Eastern Russia

<h2>Greenland:</h2>
        <p>
            Greenland, considered the largest island on the planet, is still largely undiscovered and is one of the least explored countries on Earth. The interior of Greenland is majorly inaccessible and unusable because of an enormous ice sheet that covers roughly 80% of the island and is incredibly thick (miles thick) at certain places.
            Still, although under-explored, there's plenty to do and see in Greenland; it is no surprise that a vast region covered in white has a plethora of natural wonders, including hot springs, ice-covered rivers, gemstones, the Northern Lights, and many others that entice travelers to this ice wonderland.
            However, there is still a considerable unexplored area on the Greenland Ice Sheet, making it one of the least explored spots on Earth.<br>
<b>Why it's Special:</b>It's the largest and least explored island on Earth<br>
<b>Location:</b>North America<br>  <img src="images/greenland(1).jpg" alt="Greenland" class="destination-img"></p>
